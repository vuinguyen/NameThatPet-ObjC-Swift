# NameThatPet-ObjC-Swift

NameThatPet is a "simple" iOS app written in Objective-C and Swift. I developed this app as part of the audition process to become a writer for a tutorial website. My tutorial was about converting Objective-C apps to Swift. Unfortunately, that website did not accept my tutorial, but this means that I was able to keep it as my own intellectual property. I decided to go ahead and publish the app's code to provide other developers an example of a mixed Objective-C and Swift app.

As for the tutorial, the tutorial website company forced me to use an online editor which converted my explanations into "simple" language. I felt this "simplification" made the tutorial much harder to understand, so I will have to completely rewrite it before I publish it to my website. 

In the meantime, here's the source code! To see the app itself in action, you can download a copy at:
